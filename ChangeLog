* Allow DT_REL without .rel.dyn or .rel.got (contributed by Thomas Tuegel)
* Move section headers if they would be overwritten (contributed by Thomas Tuegel)

0.15 (August 23, 2014):
* Write directly into a file instead of creating a temporary
  copy. This way PatchELFmod won't break any hardlinks.

0.14 (June 13, 2014):
* create a new DT_SONAME entry if none exists
* use libattr and libacl to copy permissions if available
  (contributed by Jeremy Sanders)

0.12.1 (April 23, 2014):
* add changelog file

0.12 (April 23, 2014):
* '--add-needed' and '--remove-needed' can now handle comma
  separated lists

0.11 (April 19, 2014):
* remove environment variable PATCHELFMOD_DEBUG
* fix some debug messages
* Add '--full-debug', which is the same as '--debug', but
  including information about rewriting symbols, which can
  be quite a lot
* code optimization

0.10 (April 10, 2014):
* '--backup' saves a backup before modifying a file.
* '--delete-rpath' deletes RPATHs and RUNPATHs.
* '--print-rpath-type' tells whether it's RPATH or RUNPATH.
* '--convert-rpath' converts an existing DT_RPATH to DT_RUNPATH.
* '--with-gold-support' makes the 'hacky support' for executables
  created by the Gold linker now optional.
* Put soname functions into single void.
* Move some code to header file.

0.9 (April 06, 2014):
* Fork "PatchELF" and rename project to "PatchELFmod".
* Add the following new options:
  --add-needed & --replace-needed (contributed by rgcjonas),
  --add-needed-list, --remove-needed-list,
  --set-soname, --print-soname
* Add short aliases for each option (-h, -I, -a, -S, ...)
* Add tests for new options.
* Changes in the no-rpath test (contributed by vdanjean),
  but without multi-arch tests.
* Add Debian folder.
* Rewrite manpage from scratch.
* Mentioning of ALL known authors.
* Other changes.

0.8 (January 15, 2014):
* Fix a segfault caused by certain illegal entries in symbol tables.

0.7 (January 7, 2014):
* Rewrite section indices in symbol tables. This for instance allows
  gdb to show proper backtraces.
* Added '--remove-needed' option.

0.6 (November 7, 2011):
* Hacky support for executables created by the Gold linker.
* Support segments with an alignment of 0 (contributed by Zack
  Weinberg).
* Added a manual page (contributed by Jeremy Sanders
  <jeremy@jeremysanders.net>).

0.5 (November 4, 2009):
* Various bugfixes.
* '--force-rpath' now deletes the DT_RUNPATH if it is present.

0.4 (June 4, 2008):
* Support for growing the RPATH on dynamic libraries.
* IA-64 support (not tested) and related 64-bit fixes.
* FreeBSD support.
* '--set-rpath', '--shrink-rpath' and '--print-rpath' now prefer
  DT_RUNPATH over DT_RPATH, which is obsolete.  When updating, if both
  are present, both are updated.  If only DT_RPATH is present, it is
  converted to DT_RUNPATH unless '--force-rpath' is specified.  If
  neither is present, a DT_RUNPATH is added unless '--force-rpath' is
  specified, in which case a DT_RPATH is added.

0.3 (May 24, 2007):
* Support for 64-bit ELF binaries (such as on x86_64-linux).
* Support for big-endian ELF binaries (such as on powerpc-linux).
* Various bugfixes.

0.2 (January 15, 2007):
* Provides a hack to get certain programs (such as the
  Belastingaangifte 2005) to work.

0.1 (October 11, 2005):
* Initial release.
